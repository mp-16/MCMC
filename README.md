# MCMC
463 MCMC project

This project was done by Maria Paolini and Carrie Long.

In this file should be the mcmc.py, MCMC(exe), this README, and all CPTs.

Learning outcomes: 
 Individually, we learned more on CPTs and how to do them effectively. We also had to figure out the coding step by step and although the logic makes sense it was complex. Lastly, since we worked together, we also learned more about github and effective team programming.
